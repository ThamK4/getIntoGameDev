I'm currently organising these folders to improve readability and reduce file duplication. From time to time a link for a video may fail, this could either be because the resource exists but has been moved, or is so out of date that it's been completely purged.

## Assets
Models and Textures used in the demos. If you open a project and it complains about not having something, this is a good place to look.
