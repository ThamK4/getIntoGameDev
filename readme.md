# getIntoGameDev
Welcome to the official getIntoGameDev github repo!

https://youtu.be/k7Lkj-88F-A?si=Jke6N8OGJeZAmGKH

I'm currently organising these folders to improve readability and reduce file duplication. From time to time a link for a video may fail, this could either be because the resource exists but has been moved, or is so out of date that it's been completely purged.

Todo: Reorganise into sections
- APIs
- Assets
- Data Oriented design
- Game Engine Topics
- Maths
- Projects
- Realtime Raytracing
- Tool Engineering

Bring in more languages

## Assets
Models and Textures used in the demos. If you open a project and it complains about not having something, this is a good place to look. Some resources have the same names (eg. skyboxes), and so some digging around is required.
