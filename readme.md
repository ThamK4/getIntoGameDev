# getIntoGameDev
Welcome to the official getIntoGameDev github repo!

I'm currently organising these folders to improve readability and reduce file duplication. From time to time a link for a video may fail, this could either be because the resource exists but has been moved, or is so out of date that it's been completely purged.

## Assets
Models and Textures used in the demos. If you open a project and it complains about not having something, this is a good place to look. Some resources have the same names (eg. skyboxes), and so some digging around is required.

## C++ Third Party Code
As a convencience, headers for common libraries such as GLFW and GLM etc. are in here.

## APIs
Graphics API-specific tutorials.

## Data Oriented Design
Take a walk on the wild side.

## Game Engine Topics
Tutorials which either could be used to build an engine, or demonstrate particularly well designed systems.

## Maths
Nothing here, yet.

## Projects
Practical applications of topics. You can expand on these to make your own stuff!

## Realtime Raytracing
It's just neat!

## Tool Engineering
An often overlooked aspect of game development. High quality tools make high quality games. I personally use PyQT for all my tool engineering, being a good combination of stable and expressive.
