# Projects

## Maze Board
Inspired by the anime series "New Game!", this was the first OpenGL project I made.

## Physics Simulations
Sometimes I'll code up little programs like this to blow off steam. Some interesting projects here.

## Python Network Programming
A simple client-server chat program.

## Retro 3D
An old-school style 3D wireframe renderer. Software rendering, very slow for some reason.

## Sugar Smash
A candy crash clone. Interesting use of search algorithms.

## Wolfenstein
Wolfenstein 3D clone in pygame.
