//multiple descriptor set layouts
1. Write new shaders, recompile.
2. Make descriptor set layouts for the frame and material bindings.
3. Pass both descriptor set layouts in pipeline creation.
4. At frame creation, make sure the correct layout variable is sent. Same at cleanup.

//asset creation
5. in create_assets, make a dictionary mapping object types to filenames.
6. create a mesh descriptor pool
7. make a texture class, right now it just takes the device, descriptor set layout, descriptor pool and filename.
8. write those into a materials dictionary.

//asset use
9. Now make a render_objects function for the renderer, bind the appropriate material in this function

//texture class
10. write out stubs for the class functions
11. in render_objects, use the material
12. in close, destroy all the materials

//load image from file
13. import image
14. write the texture's load function

//make vk image and memory
15. Make "make_image" and "make_image_memory" function, use them in the constructor
16. Destroy the image and memory in the destructor

//Populate image
17. Make a staging buffer, the texture create info will now need a physical device
18. Make a start_job and end_job function, these can use the code from memory.copy_buffer
19. Use this in the transition_image_layout function, texture create info will now need a commandBuffer and queue
20. Make a copy_buffer_to_image function and use it

//Make view
21. Make a make_image_view function, this can use the code from make_swapchain
22. Use the function to make a view, don't forget to destroy the view in cleanup

//Make sampler
23. Pretty straightforward, make the sampler, and destroy in cleanup

//Make descriptor set
24. The descriptor set should already be made, but it does need to be written to.

//New attributes/data
25. In mesh.py update the binding and attribute descriptions
26. In vertex_menagerie.consume, change the vertexCount so we're consuming 7 floats per vertex
27. Update vertexInputInfo in pipeline.py so it takes 3 vertexAttributeDescriptions
28. Add new vertex data in make_assets
